# Cursor Rails
A utility that allows you to lock the horizontal/vertical movement of your cursor using hotkeys, for more precise mouse inputs, hence the name "cursor rails", as this effectively adds "rails" onto your cursor, allowing it to only move on one axis. This utility makes use of WinAPI, and as such, is exclusive to Windows.

Using a mouse button (such as Mouse4 or Mouse5) as a hotkey is possible, but the hotkey recorder only records keyboard inputs, not mouse inputs, so you'd have to type in the VKID manually. You can find a [list of VKID's over at MSDN.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes). Built-in VKID table coming soon.
