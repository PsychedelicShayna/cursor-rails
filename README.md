# Cursor Rails
A utility that allows you to lock the horizontal/vertical movement of your cursor using hotkeys, for more precise mouse inputs, hence the name "cursor rails", as this effectively adds "rails" onto your cursor, allowing it to only move on one axis. This utility makes use of WinAPI, and as such, is exclusive to Windows.
